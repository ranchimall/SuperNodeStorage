### `processIncomingData(data)`

`processIncomingData(data)`, handles incoming data received by the server. Here's an explanation of the logic implemented in this function:

#### Functionality:

- The function takes a JSON-formatted `data` object as input, representing incoming data from clients.
- It performs several checks and processes the data based on its content and structure.
- The function distinguishes between different types of incoming data, such as requests, messages, tags, notes, and edits, and routes each type of data to the appropriate processing function.

#### Logic Explanation:

- **JSON Parsing:**
  - The incoming `data` is first parsed as a JSON object. If parsing fails, an `INVALID` error is returned, indicating that the data is not in the correct JSON format.

- **Time Validation:**
  - The function checks the timestamp (`data.time`) included in the incoming data. If the timestamp is outside the valid time window (determined by `floGlobals.sn_config.delayDelta`), an `INVALID` error is returned, indicating an invalid time.

- **Data Routing:**
  - The function examines the content of the parsed `data` object to identify its type:
    - If the `data` object contains a `request` property, it is treated as a user request and routed to `processRequestFromUser(data.request)`.
    - If the `data` object contains a `message` property, it is processed as stored data and routed to `processDataFromUser(data)`.
    - Similarly, the function handles cases where `data` contains properties like `tag`, `note`, or `edit`.
    - If the incoming data does not match any valid format, an `INVALID` error is returned, indicating invalid data format.

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - The processing of the incoming data is performed asynchronously using promises. The appropriate processing function is called based on the data type, and the processing result is resolved or rejected accordingly.

- **Logging and Error Handling:**
  - The function logs relevant information during processing, providing visibility into the server's actions.
  - Errors, including `INVALID` errors, are logged or debugged as appropriate, and the corresponding error is rejected to indicate the failure in processing.

#### Purpose and Usage:

- The `processIncomingData(data)` function serves as a central entry point for handling diverse types of incoming data from clients.

  - The function validates the digital signature (`sign`) using the sender's public key (`pubKey`) to verify the authenticity of the message.

- **Data Storage:**
  - If the data passes all validation and verification checks, it is added to the database using the `DB.addData` function. The data stored includes sender ID, receiver ID, timestamp, application, message type, message content, digital signature, and a vector clock identifier generated based on the current timestamp and sender ID.

- **Database Interaction:**
  - After storing the data, the function retrieves the stored data from the database using `DB.getData` based on the unique vector clock identifier. It resolves with an array containing the stored data, message type ('DATA'), and the database response object.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If any validation or database-related operation fails, the function rejects the promise with an `INVALID` error or the specific error encountered during the process.

#### Purpose and Usage:

- **Online Status Update:** If the user's `floID` (unique identifier) is already registered as online for the given application, the function increments the online status count for that user. This count helps track multiple WebSocket connections from the same user.
- **New Online User:** If the user's `floID` is not found in the application's online clients list, the function registers the user as online, setting their online status count to 1. Additionally, the function triggers an event to inform other clients (`informRequestClients`) that a new user has come online.
- **WebSocket Close Handling:** The function sets up a close event listener on the WebSocket connection. If the WebSocket connection is closed, it triggers the `clientOffline` function to update the user's online status accordingly.

#### Usage and Impact:
- The function ensures that clients are accurately tracked based on their online status within specific applications.
- By maintaining a count of active WebSocket connections per user (`floID`), the function can handle scenarios where a user might have multiple active connections simultaneously.

#### Process Flow:
- **Application Check:** The function first verifies if the specified `application` exists within the `onlineClients` data structure.
- **User Check:** If the application is found, the function checks if the `floID` (unique identifier) of the disconnected user is registered as online for that application.
- **Decrementing Online Status:** If the user's `floID` is found and has an online status count greater than 1, indicating multiple active connections, the function decrements the user's online status count by 1.
- **Removing User:** If the user's `floID` is found and has an online status count of 1, indicating a single active connection (the one being closed), the function removes the user from the online clients list for the specified application. It also triggers an event to inform other clients (`informRequestClients`) that the user has gone offline.
- **Empty Application Handling:** After removing the user, the function checks if there are no remaining online users for the application. If so, it deletes the application entry from the `onlineClients` data structure to maintain cleanliness.

#### Usage and Impact:

This function is essential for managing client tracking and informing clients about the online status of other users they are tracking. Here's how the function works:

#### Process Flow:
- **Client Identification:** Upon receiving a new WebSocket connection (`ws`), the function generates a unique `id` based on the current timestamp and a random string. This `id` is used to identify the specific request client connection.
- **Application Check:** The function checks if the specified `application` exists within the `requestClients` data structure. If not, a new entry is created for the application.
- **Request Client Entry:** The function adds a new entry to the `requestClients` data structure for the given `application`. This entry includes the WebSocket connection (`ws`) and the `trackList`, which contains the `floID` values of other users the client wants to track.
- **Status Initialization:** The function initializes an empty `status` object to store the online status of the tracked users (`floID`) for the specified application.
- **Status Update:** For each `floID` in the `trackList`, the function checks if the user is online (`ONLINE`) or offline (`OFFLINE`) based on their status in the `onlineClients` data structure. The current status of each tracked user is added to the `status` object.
- **Status Transmission:** The function sends the `status` object as a JSON string to the newly connected client (`ws`). This informs the client about the online status of the users they are tracking.
- **Close Event Handling:** The function registers a close event for the WebSocket connection. When the client disconnects, the `rmRequestClient` function is called to remove the client from the `requestClients` data structure.

#### Usage and Impact:
